    description: 'Edge-native quantized 2.5D fusion pipeline for real-time center of mass estimation from single RGB camera.',
    fullDescription: `At ETH Zurich’s Integrated Systems Laboratory, I developed MuyBridge, an edge-native pipeline for real-time gait analysis. The system fuses 2D keypoints with monocular depth and constructs a 2.5D latent axis to estimate the body’s center of mass. Using quantization, pruning, and Core ML export, I compressed a diffusion model of over a billion parameters to run on iPhone hardware at sub-300ms latency. The pipeline was evaluated with motion-capture data from Qualisys and supports applications ranging from sports biomechanics to Parkinson’s rehabilitation, enabling accurate, private, and scalable analysis outside the lab.`,
